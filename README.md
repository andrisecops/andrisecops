A young person who has high curiosity. Has experience as a Pentester & Digital Strategist for more than 11 years. Currently a Cyber Security Expert for several overseas companies. Really enjoying his current life as a full-time remote worker. These two things are now probably very attached to me personally. Because I have a very high curiosity, I often spend time doing anything that I think can spend my free time. I am currently actively writing about the world of cyber security at Pwn0sec. In addition to having a hobby of writing, I am currently also a Security Pentester in several companies abroad. Starting from an accident, it now officially attracts me to become a Pentester. Being a Pentester makes me free, no need to live monotonously and have to work every day in the office. Basically, I can work anywhere. Yes, I am a full-time remote worker. üí°
